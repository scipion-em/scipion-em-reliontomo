v3.1.3:
  - Fix: Use one of the halves map in auto-refine if it exists
  - Fix: LandMark model generation in prepare when a join coordinates has happened. Sorting issue.
  - Reconstruct does not generate PseudoSubtomograms.
v3.1.2:
  - Fix: Fiducial size in prepare is now correct (in Ã…)
  - Make pseudo subtomograms: float 16 is False by default and hidden. Prevents manual subsets.
v3.1.0:
  - First plugin release
